# Security Policy

## Maintenance Status

This repository is part of a curated MEng Computer Engineering project collection and is maintained in a finalized and stable state. The project is preserved as a complete and authoritative record, with its scope and contents intentionally fixed to ensure long-term academic and professional reference.

## Supported Versions

As a finalized project, only the version listed below is authoritative:

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| 1.0.0   | Yes       |

## Vulnerability Reporting Protocol

In accordance with established academic and professional standards for security disclosure, security-related observations associated with this project are documented through formal scholarly channels.

To document a security concern, communication is facilitated with the project curators:
  - **Curator**: [Amey Thakur](https://github.com/Amey-Thakur)
  - **Method**: Reports are submitted via the repository’s [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Amey-Thakur/ZERO-SHOT-VIDEO-GENERATION/issues) interface to formally record security-related findings.

Submissions include:
  1. A precise and technically accurate description of the identified issue.
  2. Demonstrable steps or technical evidence sufficient to contextualize the finding.
  3. An explanation of the issue’s relevance within the defined scope of the project.

## Implementation Context: Python-Based Machine Learning Stack
This project is implemented within a specialized machine learning technological environment, as defined by the project’s technical scope.

- **Machine Learning Environment**: Execution occurs within a Python 3.8+ environment, utilizing PyTorch and Stable Diffusion for high-fidelity video generation. The system integrates advanced computer vision pipelines, including cross-frame attention mechanisms and motion field modeling.
- **Web Interface**: The interactive demo executes through a Gradio-based server architecture, providing a local or public web interface for real-time inference and video playback.

- **Scope Limitation**: This policy applies exclusively to the source code and academic materials contained within this repository and does not extend to external models, runtime environments, or platform-level security guarantees.

## Technical Integrity Statement
This repository is preserved as a fixed academic and engineering project. Security-related submissions are recorded for documentation and contextual reference and do not imply active monitoring, response obligations, or subsequent modification of the repository.
